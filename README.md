## Introduction

The Education Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline various tasks and processes within educational institutions, such as schools and colleges. It provides administrators, teachers, students, and parents with tools to manage academics, attendance, events, payments, and more efficiently.

## Features

- **Academics Management**: Manage courses, classes, and academic records.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Track student attendance and generate reports.
- **Event Management**: Create and manage school events and activities.
- **Payment Management**: Handle fee payments and generate payment reports.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Assign roles and permissions to users for access control.
- **Parent Portal**: Enable parents to view their child's academic progress and attendance.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and Firebase Authentication for user authentication.
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **State Management**: Zustand for managing application state.
- **UI Styling**: Tailwind CSS for styling components.
- **Component Library**: Daisy UI for pre-built UI components.

## Project Structure

- **src/**
  - **components/**: Reusable UI components.
  - **pages/**: React components for different pages of the application.
  - **services/**: Firebase services for data fetching and manipulation.
  - **store/**: Zustand store for managing global state.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions.

## Database Structure

The Firebase Realtime Database is structured as follows:


Sure, here's a detailed README.md template for your Education Management System project:

```json
{
  "students": {
    // Student data
  },
  "teachers": {
    // Teacher data
  },
  "classes": {
    // Class data
  },
  "attendance": {
    // Attendance records
  },
  "events": {
    // Event data
  },
  "payments": {
    // Payment data
  }
}
```


For a more detailed explanation of the database structure, refer to [this document](link/to/database/structure.md).

## State Management

Zustand is used for managing application state, providing a simple and efficient way to handle global state across components. For more information on Zustand, refer to [the official documentation](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).

## UI Styling

Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling components, offering a utility-first approach to building user interfaces. Daisy UI provides a collection of pre-built components to enhance the UI development process. For more information on Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI, refer to [the official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [the Daisy UI repository](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui).

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/project.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up Firebase: Create a Firebase project and configure Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication.
4. Add Firebase configuration: Update the Firebase configuration in `src/services/firebase.js` with your Firebase project credentials.
